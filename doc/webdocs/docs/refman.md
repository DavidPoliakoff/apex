# API Reference Manual

The source code is instrumented with Doxygen comments, and the API reference manual can be generated by executing 'make doc' in the build directory, after CMake configuration.  A fairly recent version of the API reference documentation is also available here: <http://www.nic.uoregon.edu/~khuck/apex_docs/doc/html/index.html>
